# --ColorPicker--

_An app I made when learning Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the first time._

A main idea of this application is to help artists and especially designers with picking mathing colors in the same color scheme. After configuring a number of colors needed user can go through different color combinations until they find the ones they like. For users convenience each color item has HTML codes and RGB values as well.
